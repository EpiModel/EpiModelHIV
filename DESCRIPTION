Description: EpiModel version of MARDHAM stochastic network modeling project for
             modeling HIV-1 transmission dynamics among young men who have sex with men (MSM)
             in Atlanta. This translates and updates the original MARDHAM software
             into EpiModel modules for greater flexibility and efficiency, and then
             adds additional features like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

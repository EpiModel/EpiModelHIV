# EpiModelHIV
An R package for simulating HIV transmission dynamics among men who have sex with men and heterosexual populations, developed as an extension to our general network-based epidemic modeling platform, [EpiModel](http://epimodel.org).

You can install `EpiModelHIV` in R using `devtools`:
```
install.packages("EpiModel", dependencies = TRUE)
devtools::install_github("statnet/tergmLite")
devtools::install_github("statnet/EpiModelHIV")
```

Documentation on using this software package is forthcoming, although limited function documentation is provided within the package and available with the `help(package = "EpiModelHIV")` command.

### Note on Repository and Package Name
This Github repository `EpiModelHIV` and the R package within it were previously named `EpiModelHIVmsm`. On 6/24/2016, we merged that MSM package with our `EpiModelHIVhet` (HIV models for heterosexuals) into this combined repository and package. All scripts from those separate packages should still function with this current version after changing the input to `library`.

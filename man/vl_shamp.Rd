\description{
Module function for updating HIV viral load.
}
\details{
HIV viral load varies over time as a function of time since infection and ART
history. In the absence of ART, VL rises during the acute rising stage and
falls during the acute falling stage, until it reaches a set-point value in
chronic stage infection. VL again rises during AIDS stage disease until the
point of death.

For persons who have ever initated treatment (\code{tt.traj} is \code{3} or
\code{4}), VL changes depending on current ART use in that time step.
Current use is associated with a reduction in VL, with the rates of decline
and nadirs dependent on partial or full suppression levels. Current
non-adherence is associated with an equal level of increase to VL. All persons
who have reached AIDS, regardless of how they arrived, have a similar rate of
VL increase.

\description{
Module function for disclosure of HIV status to partners given
             non-disclosure in the past.
}
\details{
Persons who are infected may disclose their status to partners at three
distinct time points: at relationship onset for newly formed discordant
pairs; at diagnosis for pairs starting as both negative but with one newly
infected; or post diagnosis for one recently infected. The rates of disclosure
vary at these three points, and also by the partnership type.

\description{
Module function for Syphilis disease progression through multiple
             stages.
}
\details{
Syphilis disease is divided into multiple stages: incubating, primary, secondary,
early latent, late latent, tertiary, and remission. 

The time spent in chronic stage infection, and thus the time from infection to
AIDS, depends on ART history. For ART-naive persons, time to AIDS is established
by the \code{vl.aids.onset} parameter. For persons ever on ART who fall into
the partially suppressed category (the \code{tt.traj} attribute is \code{3}),
time to AIDS depends on the sum of two ratios: time on treatment over maximum
time on treatment plus time off treatment over maximum time off treatment.
For persons ever on ART who fall into the fully suppressed cateogry
(\code{tt.traj=4}), time to AIDS depends on whether the cumulative time
off treatment exceeds a time threshold specified in the \code{max.time.off.tx.full}
parameter.

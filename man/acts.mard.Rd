\item{at}{Current time step.}
}
\value{
This function returns the \code{dat} object with the updated discordant act
list (\code{dal}). Each element of \code{dal} is a data frame with the ids of the

}
\description{
Module function for setting the number of sexual acts on the
             discordant edgelist.
}
\details{
The number of acts at each time step is specified as a function of the race of
both members in a pair and the expected values within black-black, black-white,
and white-white combinations. For one-off partnerships, this is deterministically
set at 1, whereas for main and causal partnerships it is a stochastic draw
from a Poisson distribution. The number of total acts may further be modified
by the level of HIV viral suppression in an infected person.

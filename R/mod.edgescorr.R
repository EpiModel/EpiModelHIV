#' @title Adjustment for the Edges Coefficient with Changing Network Size
#'
#' @description Adjusts the edges coefficients in a dynamic network model
#'              to preserve the mean degree.

#' @details
#' In HIV/STI modeling, there is typically an assumption that changes in
#' population size do not affect one's number of partners, specified as the
#' mean degree for network models. A person would not have 10 times the number
#' of partners should he move from a city 10 times as large. This module uses
#' the adjustment of Krivitsky et al. to adjust the edges coefficients on the
#' three network models to account for varying population size in order to
#' preserve that mean degree.
#'
#' @return
#' The network model parameters stored in \code{dat$nwparam} are updated for
#' each of the three network models.
